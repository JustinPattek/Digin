This is the page where all the new ideas go before they are added to the game. 
<br>If you have an idea add it to the list for further discussion.

If your idea is card specific stick to this suggested format: 
</h3>

<font color="red">
<ul>
<li><h3>Today's Date (in bold)</h3>
<li>(Card Type) Card Name
<br>Card Job (Whether it's Offensive, defensive, support, or type of character)
<br>Card First Ability
<br>Card Second Ability (If applicable)
</ul>
</font>


If you are unsure of one of the fields, just put N/A.
Otherwise, just add it to the list.
<br>This is so we can keep this page organized and easy to read!

Idea List:
</h2>
<ul>


<li><h3>August 22, 2013</h3>
<li>(Character) N/A
<br>Assassin
<br>When you use your ability card, you get a Knife equipment (If you currently have an equipment, it gets unequipped to your hand).

<li>(Supplies) Knife
<br>Offensive
<br>Equip: If you land on a player, throw 2 of their cards into the graveyard.
<br>(The knife can only be equipped by the Assassin or the Shapeshifter when he is copying the Assassin)
<br>(The Knife can't be unequipped by the holder, possibly?)



<li><h3>August 28, 2013</h3>
<li>(Character) Paul
<br> Magician
<br> Take an equip card from another player

<li>(Supplies) Turbo Shovel
<br>Support
<br>Equip: Similar to shovel, but you guess the card underground before you flip it face-up and if you guess correctly you can roll again.

<li>(Character) N/A
<br>Bounty Hunter
<br>N/A
