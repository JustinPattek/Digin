<h1>Digin</h1>
<h3>
A really fun, slightly competitive card game for you and your friends!</h3>
<h4>Seriously, who doesn't love digging and murder?
</h4>

<h2>
Game-play:
</h2>

<h3>
Objective:
</h3>
The objective of the game is to collect the most Victory Cards.
The game ends when the pile of Victory Cards runs out. Whoever has the most at that point and is currently alive wins! You can also win by killing all the other players.
A player is dead when he/she has no more cards besides their character card and Victory Cards. (This means the cards in your hand and your equipment)
Everyone has a hand of cards and the game is played on a field of cards called the Map.

<h3>
Starting A Game:
</h3>
To start the game, you take the deck of cards (not including the character and victory cards) and shuffle it. 
<br>The everyone playing chooses a character card. (you pass all the character cards around the table)
<br>You then distribute 5 cards from the top of the deck to each player. This will be each players hand (or Inventory).
<br>You then take the majority of the deck of cards and build a 5 x 5, 6 x 6, or 7 x 7 grid of face-down cards, without looking at them.
<br>This will be the game board (or Map).
<br>(More advanced players can make the game board any shape they want as long as every card has another card to at least one of its 4 sides)
<br>The rest of the deck gets placed somewhere near the map, but not on top of it. This will be the discard deck (or Graveyard).
<br>Each player then puts his/her Character card on the map, on top of one of the face-down cards of their choosing.
<br>Make sure that each character card is a reasonable distance away from each-other.
<br>The last player to choose a Character card is the first player to take their turn.

<h3>
Game-play Elements:
</h3>
The Map is the game board where the entire game takes place. 
<br>It consists of a random number and order of face-down cards from the deck. 
<br>Players take turns rolling a 6-sided die and then moving vertically or horizontally along the map, the appropriate amount of cards equal to the number that they rolled.
<br>Face-down cards are considered "Underground". 
<br>When a player is finished moving on the map, they are given a choice whether or not to uncover the underground card.
<br>If they choose to uncover the card, they flip it face-up. At that point the card's "Pick-up" ability activates and the players who can view the card depends on the card's visibility.
<br>The player then puts the uncovered card into their hand (or Inventory) and must put a card from their hand back down underground in that same position. 
<br>(The card they replace with the uncovered card could in fact be the same card they just picked up.)

The Cards are all based around items that have been buried underground. 

<h3>
A typical turn consists of
</h3>
<ul>
<li>If you have any cards you would like to equip to your character, you may do so.
<br>Only 1 equipment at a time. You can also unequip stuff during this phase.
<br>(When you do you take the card that was on your character already, if there was one, and put it in your hand)
<li>You roll the die.
<br>(If a character has whiskey, he/she moves now and can look at the card they land on)
<li>You move your character card the appropriate amount of spaces in any direction (north, south, east or west) except diagonally. 
<li>You can then look at the Map card that you land on, do what it says (the pick-up effect) and take the card and swap it with one in your hand 
<br>(including that card)
<li>You don't have to look at the card you land on.
<li>If you land on a space where someone already occupies you can use your Offensive equipment card on them. (If more than one person occupies a space the Offensive Equipment activates on everyone on that space.)
</ul>

How You Can Contribute:
</h2>
I decided to make this game open-source where anyone can contribute. 
<br>I feel that since the best way to enjoy this game is with a lot of friends, the best way to make this game is with a whole lot of friends too!

<h3>
So, what do I have to do to become a collaborator?
</h3>
<br>Well, first things first you need a GitHub account. It's free to join and super easy to use!
<br>Then you need to play Digin with someone who is already a collaborator.
<br>And only then can you become a collaborator.

<h3>
What can I do as a collaborator?
</h3>
<br>To put it simply... Anything and everything. 
<br>Whenever you have an idea for Digin put it in the "Ideas" folder
<br>Start discussing your idea and join in the discussion of other ideas and about whether or not they should be included in the final game.
<br>When a card is finally agreed upon in the "Ideas" folder, it can be created in the appropriate card folder.
<br>If you see any issues with Digin or any Digin pages, let everyone know in the "Issues/Fixes" section.

<h2>
A Little History:
</h2>
I started this game project in my dorm room in Binghamton University. 
<br>I wanted to create a game that had the level of fun equal to a game of Super Mario Party and a level of competitiveness close to a game of Magic The Gathering.
<br>I've always been really into card games, but one thing I don't really like is how expensive they can get and how specific some games are. 
<br>My initial goal was to make a game that was extremely versatile. It could be played many different ways, with any number of cards from the deck.
<br>I wanted the game to be able to be updated in the future, where new cards could be added and players could mix and match their cards so that the game would be different each time you played!
<br>I also wanted the game to be able to be played by as many people as possible.
<br>The game started out as a small project and after tons of play-testing has grown a lot since then. 
<br>I can't wait to see how it looks when it's finished!
