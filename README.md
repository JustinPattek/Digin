<h1>Digin (Working Title) (also: Shovel Party)</h1>
A competitive card game for you and your friends!

Everyone has a hand of cards and there is a field of cards called the Map.

<h2>
There are 8 characters:
</h2>
Billy the Lumberjack
Sandy the Vampire
Joe the Normal guy
A1 the steak sauce Robot
Lily the sneaky Thief
Steve the gambling Jester
Amy the gold-digger 
Greg the scariest Ghost


<h2>
They each have 1 unique ability:
</h2>
Billy can equip two things
Sandy can take a card from the graveyard
Joe can shuffle the map (maybe fill holes)
A1 can use a players equipment on them.
Lily can steal any non-coin card from a players hand
Steve can switch hands with a player
Amy can steal any coin from a players hand
Greg can teleport to any place on the map

Abilities must be unlocked by using an ability card from your hand.
ability cards work like a stack in magic (FIFO)

<h2>
Game-play:
</h2>
The objective of the game is to collect the most gold before the set amount of turns. (Average amount of turns is 20)
You can also win by killing the other players. You die when you have no more cards besides your character card. (This includes the cards in your hand and your equipment)

<h2>
The Set Up:
</h2>
To start the game, you take a bunch of cards that you like and shuffle them in a pile. 
This will be the Map.
Each player begins the game with their character card on the field in a fair space in front of them. Each player also begins with their hand consisting of 1 bomb card, and 3 coins and 1 rock.
Each player rolls to see who goes first and the turn order is set from there.

<h3>
A typical turn consists of
</h3>
If you have any cards you would like to equip to your character , you may do so.
Only 1 equipment at a time. You can also unequip stuff during this phase.
(when you do you take the card that was on your character already, if there was one, and put it in your hand)
You roll the die.
(If a character has whiskey, he/she moves now and can look at the card they land on)
You move your character card the appropriate amount of spaces in any direction (north, south, east or west) except diagonally. 
You can then look at the Map card that you land on, do what it says (the pick-up effect) and take the card and swap it with one in your hand (including that card)
You don't have to look at the card you land on.
If you land on a space where someone already occupies:
you "use" your equipment card on them.

<h2>

<h2>
ISSUES / FIXES:
</h2>
<h3>
April 19, 2013
</h3>
shovel OP
bombs too good if they last forever
too difficult
<h3>

shovel fixed
bombs better if they go off and you discard (and destroy the land) and then if you equip they are used as defense
bombs can't kill someone (if you have one card and you land on a bomb you discard a card and then pick up the bomb...NEEDS FIXING)

Should ability cards give you dirt piles when you use them?

discarding the flag is too difficult
(catapult helps? not sure)
(perhaps the flag goes back face-up)
it felt weird changing focus from collecting gold to trying to figure out how to discard the flag
(maybe multiple flags?)

changed running boots (maybe too good now? we'll see)
detective item idea
discard from the map idea
give a card to a player idea

maybe change the coins to artifacts and they are archeologists digging for the pieces and when you get all of them its like super powerful?
(it's time to introduce some back-story to the game)
seriously considering getting rid of the flag
instruments?
<h3>

</h3>
ability cards need to be "exiled" otherwise Sandy infinite dirt combo happens.
Amy's ability needs to be only the hand
change shop to trading post and you can exchange goods in team play
(maybe add random cards to sell)
woman's purse only takes a coin from hand
bomb blows up hand or equip (you don't choose though)
maybe the game can come with a grid - pad to draw out the map (so you can learn the lay of the land)
(it would make joe better)
equip card face-up in front of you
<h3>

Ability cards only exiled when used.
thinking about fixing catapult and shop and shovel.
