This is the folder that you should post ideas about characters who have abilities that are too easy to exploit.
Post a file for the character you think is op with their name as the name of the file. If there already is a file, 
open it and add your ideas to the end of it. Give the previous ideas some space (add 2 lines of whitespace).
If you're the file maker add this to the top of the file:
Character Name: the character's name

Follow this outline to report a character being op
Name: your name
Date: the current date
Ability: some ability that is way too good
Reason it is OP: if the character has an interaction that is really easy to exploit 
		put that here or if their ability is just too good that works too
Suggested balancing act: put a suggestion on how to fix mr, ms, mrs, or master (dr?) brokenpants
Changelog action: when you first put this here put it as changed if you're going to go straight
to the card list and make the change, pending if you're not sure the change is good, or will not
change if it is thrown away for whatever reason.
