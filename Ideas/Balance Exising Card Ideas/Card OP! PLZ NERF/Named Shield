Name: Kenneth Thornhill
Date: September 4, 2013
Card Name: Named Shield
Card type: Defensive
Card Ability: Every turn, every player not in your vicinity discards a card.

Reason it is OP: It's not really OP per se, but it doesn't fit the defensive type imo. I think it would be a 
great offensive card, but not quite for defense.
Suggested balancing act: Make a new offensive item with this effect and change this card's effect.
Suggested new effects: Block any effect, destroys opponent's equipment, then gets destroyed.

Changelog action: waiting for others' approval
