Card type: artifact

Card ability: 
	Pickup: None
	Equip: Whenever you land on someone you can use your character's ability

Reason it is OP: it's too good for some characters and can potentially break the game

Suggested balancing act: Instead of using your ability whenever you land on someone it should
be changed to a support type artifact that prevents all (including you) from using abilities while you
have it equipped.

Reason for suggested balancing: It makes more sense for the game
