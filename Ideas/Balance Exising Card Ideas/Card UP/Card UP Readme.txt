This is the folder that you should post ideas about cards that seem under powered. 
This folder should not contain balancing ideas about character cards (that's what the character up folder is for). 
If you could keep it to one file per card in this format:

Filename: Name of that sad, pathetic under powered card

If you are the file creator add this line to the top:
Card name: some card's name

Follow this outline to report an under powered card:
Name: your name
Date: the date
Card type: support, offensive, defensive, other
Card ability: this card tries to cry a little but then cries a lot. skip your next 12 turns
Reason it is UP: Whenever I play this card my opponent always ends up killing me in 11 turns.
Suggested balancing act: Character gets frightened and loses a turn but the turn after that runs in horror (roll 2 die)
Reason for suggested balancing: The wording makes it seem like you don't win so obviously 
you'd feel worse playing it and would discard if you reveal a bomb.
Changelog action: when you first put this here put it as changed if you're going to go straight
to the card list and make the change, pending if you're not sure the change is good, or will not
change if it is thrown away for whatever reason.
