Name: Kenneth Thornhill
Date: September 4, 2013
Card Name: Bomb
Card type: Defensive
Pick-up ability: Discard a card
Equip: Make player discard a card, hand or equip.

Reason for UP: No one will ever land on you ever if you have this equipped. Shield already does this.

Suggested Balancing Act: Rework into "Alluring Time-Bomb"

Card Name: Alluring Time-Bomb
Card type: Defensive
Pick-up ability: Discard a card.
Equip: Everyone in the game must try and land on you, even if they are too far to do so in one turn. When
someone lands on you, discard one of their cards (equip or hand).

Reason for suggested balancing: Will mix the game up and will actually let players use the card's effect. Luck will
also determine outcome, and lower rolls will be preferred over normal larger ones, which is different and exciting.
