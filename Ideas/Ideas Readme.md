<h1>
IDEAS
</h1>
<h3>
This is the section where all the new ideas go before they are added to the game. 
</h3>
If you have an idea add it to the appropriate folder for further discussion.

If your idea is card specific stick to this suggested format: 
<br>

<ul>
<li><h3>Today's Date (in bold)</h3>
<li>(Card Type) Card Name
<br>Card Job (Whether it's Offensive, defensive, support, or type of character)
<br>Card First Ability
<br>Card Second Ability (If applicable)
</ul>
<br>

<br>This is so we can keep these folders organized and easy to read!
