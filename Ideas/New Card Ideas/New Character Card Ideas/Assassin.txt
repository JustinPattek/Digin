Assassin
When you use your ability card, you get a Knife equipment 
(If you currently have an equipment, it gets unequipped to your hand).

Knife
Offensive
Equip: If you land on a player, throw 2 of their cards into the graveyard.
(The knife can only be equipped by the Assassin or the Shapeshifter 
when he is copying the Assassin)
(The Knife can't be unequipped by the holder, possibly?)
