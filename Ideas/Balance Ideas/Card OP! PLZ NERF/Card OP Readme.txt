This is the folder that you should post ideas about cards that seem over powered. Not that this folder should not contain balancing ideas 
about character cards (that's what the character op folder is for). 

Filename: Name of that dirty, mean op card

If you are the file's creator add this line to the top:
Card name: some card's name

To report your view on why the card is overpowered follow this outline:
Card type: support, offensive, defensive, other
Card ability: this card wins you the game
Reason it is OP: it wins you the freaking game. nothing's more OP than that!
Suggested balancing act: Should only make your opponents all lose the game.
Reason for suggested balancing: The wording makes it seem like you don't win so obviously you'd feel worse playing it and would discard if you reveal a bomb.
