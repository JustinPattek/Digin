</h3>
<ul>
<li>Issue: shovel is too strong
<li>Issue: bombs are too good if they last forever
<li>Issue: Game is too difficult
</ul>
<h3>
April 20, 2013
</h3>
<ul>
<li>Fix: shovel fixed
<li>Fix: bombs better if they go off and you discard (and destroy the land) and then if you equip they are used as a defense
<li>Issue: bombs can't kill someone (if you have one card and you land on a bomb you discard a card and then pick up the bomb...NEEDS FIXING)

<li>Issue: Should ability cards give you dirt piles when you use them?

<li>Issue: discarding the flag is too difficult
(catapult helps? not sure)
(perhaps the flag goes back face-up)
<li>Issue: It felt weird changing focus from collecting gold to trying to figure out how to discard the flag
(maybe multiple flags?)

<li>Fix: changed running boots (maybe too good now? we'll see)
<li>Fix: detective item idea
<li>Fix: discard from the map idea
<li>Fix: give a card to a player idea
</ul>
<h3>
April 23, 2013
</h3>
<ul>
<li>Issue: maybe change the coins to artifacts and they are archeologists digging for the pieces and when you get all of them its like super powerful?
(it's time to introduce some back-story to the game)
<li>Issue: seriously considering getting rid of the flag
<li>Issue: instruments?
</ul>
<h3>
April 24, 2013
</h3>
<ul>
<li>Fix: ability cards need to be "exiled" otherwise Sandy infinite dirt combo happens.
<li>Fix: Amy's ability needs to be only the hand
<li>Fix: change shop to trading post and you can exchange goods in team play
(maybe add random cards to sell)
<li>Fix: woman's purse only takes a coin from hand
<li>Fix: bomb blows up hand or equip (you don't choose though)
<li>Issue: maybe the game can come with a grid - pad to draw out the map (so you can learn the lay of the land)
(it would make Joe better)
<li>Issue: equip card face-up in front of you (instead of under character card)
</ul>
<h3>
April 26, 2013
</h3>
<ul>
<li>Fix: Ability cards only exiled when used.
<li>Issue: thinking about fixing catapult and shop and shovel.
<li>Issue: thinking about expansion packs (booster packs with extra cards that you can add to your Map and games)
<li>Issue: thinking about new characters (possibly a man with his dog, the ability can be a 2nd character to move around!!!!)
<li>Issue: thinking about pets/ instruments
</ul>
<h3>
April 27, 2013
</h3>
<ul>
<li>Fix: Added Names for the different Card Types (offensive, defensive, support)
<li>Fix: Equip cards are now called: Supplies cards
<li>Fix: Changed coins to gold (Still not sure if I want to keep the coin values 1 and 3 or 1 and 2)
<li>Issue: Thinking about some sort of card that you get to replace an ability card besides dirt?
<li>Issue: change dark shovel to grave shovel?
<li>Fix: The old man and his dog:
<br>Use your ability and the dog comes out
<br>The dog has the same equipment that you have
<br>If the dog lands on someone the equipment activates
<br>(if someone lands on the dog, it goes home)
<br>Either you move the dog on your turn or you move it on the turn after you or the turn you summon it.
<li>Fix: Turbo Shovel: if you pick-up a dirt pile or coin, you roll again.
</ul>
<h3>
April 29, 2013

<li>Issue: Perhaps add another use for money? (buying something)
<li>Issue: Make shovel more appealing
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Fix: Fool's Gold!
</ul>
<h3>
May 12th, 2013
</h3>
<ul>
<li>Dark shovel: Show a player your hand and they decide how many non-coin cards to discard
<li>A1 : negates abilities now
<li>Switch abilities so they go to graveyard and Sandy's ability is now: Take a non-ability card from the graveyard
<li>Old Man and Dog - 
<br>Ability: Old man summons dog.
<br>They both share a dice roll (you can divide the roll to each character)
<br>If any player lands on the dog, it goes home and your equipment activates on the man
<br>If the dog lands on any player, the man's equipment activates
<br>(Maybe the old man and dog can swap map cards)
<li>Pure Evil: Deal with the devil, land on a player and discard a coin card to take their next turn
<li>When Joe randomizes the map, he can't make gaps
<li>Highest roll chooses a character first and doesn't show it and then players choose clockwise.
</ul>

<li>A shield item (defensive)
<li>Switch item with the graveyard
<li>Swap spaces on the map

<li>Should the graveyard be face up or face down?
<li>sun tan lotion
<li>More long range items
<li>Medusa's ass cheeks: Choose a random card from the closest player's hand and replace it for dirt. "This part of the myth, I don't remember."

</ul>
<h3>
August 21, 2013
</h3>
<ul>
<li>"Dig" Cards will be added (in preparation for the Digin 2.0 update)
<li>Removing the 20 turn game limit
<li>The game now ends when all "Dig" cards have been drawn.
<li>"Dig" cards will either be drawn during a players turn, instead of taking their turn, or purchased for a coin price.
<li>Characters now each have a "bounty" depending on how impressive their ability is. 
<br>When you kill this character you get their character card, which now counts as a coin card with a value equal to the bounty value.
<li>Possible theme: A post apocalyptic world, where the characters want to find refuge and are promised riches underground.
<br>(Or maybe something to do with maps, if we change the "Dig" cards to Map cards)
<li>Coin values will have to be altered to reflect these changes.
<li>Character cards will have to be altered to reflect these changes.
<li>Supplies cards will have to be altered to reflect these changes.
<li>Card priority needs to be set
<li>Ability cards need to be re-thought.
<li>Perhaps we get rid of Fool's gold?
<li>Are artifacts necessary?
<li>Card "visibility" should be altered/re-thought. 
<br>(Which cards have eye-balls?, Should all cards be required to be shown?)
</ul>
<h3>
August 28, 2013
</h3>
<ul>
<li>Fix: Victory cards added (still unsure of how many)
<br>They can be bought for 3 gold each on a player's turn before they move.
<br>You win by having the most victory cards, but if you die your victory cards a voided.
<li>Fix: Characters now each have a "bounty" depending on how impressive their ability is. 
<br>When you kill this character you get their character card, which now counts as a coin card with a value equal to the bounty value.
<li>Fix: Added Facebook page and split up GitHub README file.
<li>Fix: Treasure chest take a coin from the graveyard and then it goes to the graveyard
<li>Added drawing from the graveyard and then took it away
<li>Issue: Need more positive effect cards
<li>Issue: Need a set priority for when a player has 1 card.
<li>Fix: Whatever happens to one of Billy's items, happens to them all.
<li>Issue: Dark shovel and frog need to be fixed.
<li>Cards are considered "Underground" when they are face-down on the map.
</ul>
<h3>
August 29, 2013
</h3>
<ul>
<li>Fix: the ability artifact now prevents abilities from being used
<br>rather than using your ability everytime you land on a player.
<br>(This is because some characters don't benefit from using their abilities only on their turn)
<li>Fix: Tino fixed up the Ideas section and added balancing section/ Map ideas
</ul>
